        "Based on the model, it found that class 1 for males and class 1 for females are the same. Also class 0 for both male and female are also the same. The numbers are the same because the model made the same amount of wrong predictions for toxic female comments and toxic male comments. The model made 4 wrong predictions for each category but it was 100% accurate with non-toxic comments. Based on this, it seems that the model is good at accurately classifying non-toxic comments correctly. However, I think that the reason I got the same numbers for class 1 is because the test comments might've been too directly toxic. To make the model have more varying numbers, it is best to make the test comments more subtle or indirect with the toxicity.\n",

        "Overall, this model proved my hypothesis wrong as I originally stated that the female toxic comments will get flagged more than the male toxic comments, but since it was pretty direct and obvious on which comments were toxic, the model made pretty accurate predicitions with the same amount of errors on each gender. I hope to revise the test comments and test this model again by making my comments more subtle or short. I might even try to get my comments from online such as Twitter to see what results I get. Although this model conclusions don't show it, I think there is some bias with the model because when I was testing out my demo-comments, I found that the model would find female comments that are pretty toxic to not be toxic but it would correctly identify a male's comment to be toxic even if it is somewhat subtle.
